## Project Description

My Health App is a fitness and wellness tracker where users can input their daily acivities and meals to work towards their goals. Users can also add friends and see their weekly stats. This is a health app for users who want to focus on awareness of their health journey.

This app will include a backend database using MongoDB and Express.js and a frontend web application using Node.js and React.

## Team Responsibilities

Overall we want to work on this project as a team- step by step. We will split up Models/Compenents when working on the frontend or backend. But we will work on the same part of the project together and not split up.

- Lauren- Create a model, work on CR routes, and one component
- Anju- Create a model, work on CR routes, and one component
- Rebecca- Create a model, work on UD routes, and one component
- Kae- Create a model, work on UD routes, and one component

## User Stories

The user of our app will check in daily- preferably at the end of their day- to submit their activities, meals, and weight for the day. At the end of the week they will check their My Health Page to see aggragated data and how they are tracking to their goals. This app is a positive part of their day and they feel accomplished submitting their good decisions. Keeping a journal of your day to day activity and meals is a great way to reinforce the positive impacts of a healthy lifestyle.
